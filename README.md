SG 1 - Ydheal
Sistema de Gerencialmento (Managing System)

Ydheal was my first ever fully developed system. It's goal it's to manage a locksmith's flow of information, from order creation until the order has been paid. Ydheal was created as a completion of course work for my IT Technician degree.
It was built using Java, swing for it's design and MySQL server. In it you'll find:

- Poorly stcucted MVC arquitecture
- Poorly handled Connection Pool
- User interactive design
- Information flow
